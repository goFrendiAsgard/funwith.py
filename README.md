Motivation
==========

I am Go Frendi Gunawan, a lecturer in STIKI Malang, Indonesia.
Here, lecturer only get a small amount of salary. My basic salary is just about 750,000 IDR (about 61 USD). I have teach for about 4 years by now.
With such a small salary, I will never be able to have my own house. A cheap house in Malang (where I lived) is about 400,000,000 IDR.
I will need to spend 3,000,000 IDR/month which is much greater than my revenue. I'll never have a house by being a mere lecturer.

Government, under DIKTI department has a solution for this. Annually they accept research-proposal from lecturers around Indonesia.
The proposal will be filtered by their own regulation, and the accepted-applicants will be granted with research fund.
This is actually a very good mechanism. 

What I don't really like is about fund-usage-composition.
Please look at [this](readme-resource/Panduan_Pelaksanaan_Penelitian_dan_PPM_Edisi_ IX 2013.pdf) on page 103 for more detail information.

The composition is as follows:
* Researcher Salary: maximum 20%
* Consumables: maximum 40-60%
* Trip: maximum 15%
* Others (publication, report, etc): maximum 10-15%

I am a computer scientist. What I need to do the research is just some books, gather some data, internet connection, and my own laptop.
Basically it is almost zero-cost.

So, how much can I get from my own research? 20% from almost-zero. Nothing.

Some applicants tend to lie, markup the cost, and do other bad things. This is said to be common.
I was once try to do so, but then I stop this unreal-research which has unrealistic-funding before it is finished. 
I decide to not doing such a bad thing anymore, I don't feel comfortable doing that, and I don't feel comfortable receive such a dirty money.

I am a lecturer, a teacher, an educator. I should tell my students about education, science and moral.
But I won't have any right to speak about moral if I don't have a good moral by myself.

I can't rely on my institution, nor I can rely on government. I can only rely on my own ability and humanity.

The idea is very simple. I'll share my knowledge, write it online, so that you can access it freely.
However, you can buy the printed version (I'll look for publisher for this) to help me being a good guy who has a good living.
